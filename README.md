Image Classification of 3 images: Sunflower, Rugby Ball Leather & Ice Cream Cone --->
Identifies the image and gives the predicted output.

Created dataset using Bing/ Google Image search APIs.
And then labelling them simplifies the entire process, and adds flexibility to the flow of machine learning for the Data Gathering.

We downloaded 30 images of each by using the python library 'bing-image-downloader' and stored them in the images directory.
Also performed various operations on the data and used techniques like 'GridSearchCV' and SVM algorithm to get the desired output.

You can use the following url's of images to run the code and get the output, or use any other jpg images for testing.
